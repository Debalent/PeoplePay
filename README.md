2. Install dependencies for the client:

```powershell
cd app
npm install
cd ..
```

3. Start the dev servers (runs both client and backend):

```powershell
npm run dev
```

The client (Vite) will be in `app/` and backend Express server will run at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

This scaffold uses React + Vite (TypeScript) for the frontend and Node + Express for the backend. Styling uses Bootstrap.
