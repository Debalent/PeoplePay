## üìû **Phone Call Script**

```
"Hi Arlo, this is Demond Balentine. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me.

I wanted to personally follow up on the PeoplePay enterprise platform I shared with you. 

Did you have a chance to run through the demonstration? 

[LISTEN TO RESPONSE]

What I'm really excited to discuss with you is the market timing. We're seeing unprecedented demand for compliant fintech infrastructure, especially with the new regulatory requirements coming into effect.

PeoplePay eliminates what typically takes 18-24 months of compliance work and represents a $500K+ development investment that's already complete.

Arlo, based on your portfolio focus, I see three potential fits:

1. **Direct Acquisition** - Add a production-ready fintech platform to your holdings
2. **Strategic Partnership** - License the technology for your existing portfolio companies  
3. **Investment Round** - Join our Series A to scale the platform globally

Which of these resonates most with your current investment strategy?"

[DISCOVERY QUESTIONS]
- What's your typical investment range for fintech platforms?
- Are you looking for immediate revenue-generating assets?
- How important is regulatory compliance in your evaluation criteria?
- What's your timeline for fintech investments in 2025?

[CLOSING]
"Arlo, I appreciate your time and insights. Would you be open to a deeper dive session where my technical team can walk through the architecture and we can discuss specific terms?"
